      <p>It is a period of civil war.
      Rebel spaceships, striking
      from a hidden base, have won
      their first victory against
      the evil Galactic Empire.</p>

      <p>During the battle, Rebel
      spies managed to steal secret
      plans to the Empire's
      ultimate weapon, the DEATH
      STAR, an armored space
      station with enough power
      to destroy an entire planet.</p>

      <p>Pursued by the Empire's
      sinister agents, Princess
      Leia races home aboard her
      starship, custodian of the
      stolen plans that can save her
      people and restore
      freedom to the galaxy....</p>
